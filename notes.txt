  20 |   <div className="price">Rs.{Product.price}</div>

  21 |   <div>

> 22 |     <Link to={`/seller/${Product.seller._id}`}>

 | ^  23 |       {Product.seller.seller.name}

  24 |     </Link>

ANSWER:
it is because of changing data model. 
Follow these steps to fix this error:

1- Login with this seller account and in User Profile set a name for this seller.

2- Make sure you have a user with this id (product.seller._id) or not. if you deleted that user you need to delete the product too and create it again. make sure for current user you have set the seller name in User profile.

If it does not work you can simply clone the course repo:
